# Frontend Dashboard App with Backend Graph Integration - Solution

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for the Evaluation Assignment - Building a Frontend Dashboard App with Backend Graph Integration. The goal was to create a complex web app with a user-friendly UI based on a provided Figma design, utilizing ReactJs for the frontend and Nodejs for the backend. The key feature is the integration of an interactive graph component with downsampling for efficient rendering.


## Demo

Check out the live demo of the app [here](deployed_link).

## Features

- **Adherence to Figma Design:** The UI closely follows the provided Figma design in terms of layout, colors, fonts, and components.
  
- **Interactive Graph Component:** The graph represents the relationship between profit percentage and time. It is interactive, allowing users to explore the data dynamically.

- **Efficient Downsampling Algorithm:** Implemented a downsampling algorithm to reduce the dataset size while preserving essential trends, ensuring optimal performance.

- **Backend API Endpoints:** The backend provides API endpoints for fetching data based on different time intervals (1 week, 1 month, 1 year, all).

- **Deployment:** The app is deployed on [Vercel/Netlify/fly.io/render.com/any other platform].
